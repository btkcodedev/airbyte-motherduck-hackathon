For all you speedy folks out there, here‚Äôs the scoop:

  With your customer reviews in motherduck, along with your chosen business stack and areas of interest, Analysr is ready to dish out some insightful analytics.

## Walkthrough

1) To obtain customer review insights, sync your data to Motherduck with the schema: <code>{ "review_text": "string", "stars": "number" }</code> (More schemas will be supported soon). We recommend using Airbyte due to its extensive list of sources and seamless data movement. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/415aece5-6594-4649-8d84-ec2fa1707988)
