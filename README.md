## 1Ô∏è‚É£ One Liner
This is my submission for <code>Airbyte-Motherduck Hackathon - December 2024 - January 2025</code>

For all you speedy folks out there, here‚Äôs the scoop:

- **1.0.0**  
  With your customer reviews in motherduck, along with your chosen business stack and areas of interest, Analysr is ready to dish out some insightful analytics. And just to sweeten the deal, Groq has stepped in to help you navigate all your growth phases‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt want a sidekick in business?

Your analytics lineup features Aspect Analysis, a Word Sentiment Heatmap (for those feelings), Advanced Text Analysis, Groq Business Analytics, Keyphrase Analysis, and a handy Competitor Comparison.

## Walkthrough

1) To obtain customer review insights, sync your data to Motherduck with the schema: <code>{ "review_text": "string", "stars": "number" }</code> (More schemas will be supported soon). We recommend using Airbyte due to its extensive list of sources and seamless data movement.
2) Visit the Analysr website at (growwithanalysr.web.app) and click on the "Get Started Now" button.
3) Select your business stack and substack; Groq and queries will use this information to fetch insights.
4) Input your Motherduck token and wait for the connection to be established (the time required will depend on your network bandwidth).
5) Select the database and table where your customer reviews or any related reviews exist, and set the data limit.
6) Input your Groq token (recommended) to obtain AI-based insights.
7) Optionally provide your Airbyte bearer token (from the cloud.airbyte.com settings page) and connection ID (from the connections tab URL) to trigger a sync for updating your Motherduck table.
8) Finally, input your area of interest for insights, such as customer satisfaction, and click "Continue to Dashboard."
9) Wait a few seconds until all queries are executed and visualized.
10) Voil√†! Your dashboard will be ready, featuring all the capabilities of Analysr to support your next big step!
